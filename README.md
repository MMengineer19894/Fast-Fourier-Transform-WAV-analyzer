FFT .wav file analyzer that produces plots written in Python.

Libraries used are numpy, scipy.io, matplotlib, tkinter.

Upon clicking "Select Files" button and importing a .wav file, you will be prompted with number of harmonics you wish to analyze.

Sample .wav file of Harp C3 note included in Assets folder.

Rest is pretty much self explanatory.

Feel free to add to the code.
